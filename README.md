Test assignment for Product Designer


Design Brief:
Create a one-page landing design to promote and sell the top 10 books of your choice. The genre of the books is up to you. The design should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and enticing to potential book buyers. The landing page should share the same branding as MailerSend but it could be improved.

Deliverable:
1. Explain your decisions.
2. Provide a link to a GitHub repository with the project files (HTML and CSS).
3. Host the final result on a platform of your choice (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any other hosting service) and provide the link (optional).
4. If you have any design mockups (e.g., Figma, Sketch), share the internal link for review.


Bonus:
1. Write clean, semantic HTML code following best practices without using frontend frameworks.
2. Create a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
3. Implement CSS animations or transitions to enhance the user experience if desired.
